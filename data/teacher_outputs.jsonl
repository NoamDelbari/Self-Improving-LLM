{"question": "Did Disney get most of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book profits?", "student_draft": "Answer: No\nClarifying questions: Are we considering the entirety of the profits or just the initial sale? Does the term \"most\" refer to a specific percentage or amount?", "teacher_thought": "1. Disney adapted \"The Jungle Book\" into a film in 1967, which became highly successful and generated significant profits.  \n2. The original book by Rudyard Kipling was published in 1894, long before Disney's adaptation, and Kipling did not receive ongoing profits from film adaptations.  \n3. Typically, authors earn royalties from book sales, but major film studios like Disney usually retain most of the profits from their adaptations, not the original authors.  \n4. Therefore, Disney likely earned most of the profits from their \"Jungle Book\" film, not Kipling.  \n\nFinal answer: **No**", "teacher_answer": "No"}
