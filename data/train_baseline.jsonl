Without specific data, we need an estimate or to consider the question as hypothetical.\n\nStep 3: To fill 500 battalions, you would need 500 times the size of one battalion. Using our average of 500 soldiers per battalion, that totals 250,000 people.\n\nStep 4: Without concrete data on the number of Atlantic readers"}
