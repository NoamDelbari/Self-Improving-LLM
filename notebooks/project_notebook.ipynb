    "# ENHANCED EVALUATION: QUESTION QUALITY & REASONING FAITHFULNESS\n",
    "This section implements comprehensive evaluation metrics specifically designed for Q&A-CoT format:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question Quality Assessment**: Evaluates the clarity, relevance, and logical progression of self-generated questions\n",
    "2. **Reasoning Faithfulness**: Measures how well the answers align with factual knowledge and logical reasoning\n",
    "3. **Chain-of-Thought Coherence**: Assesses the logical flow and consistency across the Q&A sequence\n",
    "4. **Final Answer Accuracy**: Traditional accuracy measurement with confidence scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "- After completing progressive curriculum training\n",
    "- Before and after token emphasis training to measure improvement\n",
    "- For model comparison between different training approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detailed evaluation metrics saved to `enhanced_evaluation_results.json`\n",
    "- Question quality analysis and reasoning faithfulness scores\n",
    "- Comparative analysis with baseline and previous training phases"

    "- **Dataset Acquisition & Sampling:** download the StrategyQA dataset, sample ~2 000 training examples as recommended, and save them to disk for subsequent processing.\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering & Teacher Generation:** generate a baseline *student draft* for each question, compose prompts according to the plan (question, student draft, and a teacher instruction), call GPT‑4 (or run in dry‑run mode), and build two parallel corpora for baseline and CoT training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan specifies a data‑generation loop where each question is paired with a student draft and a teacher chain‑of‑thought, resulting in two training tracks.  The baseline model is trained on `(Q → answer)` pairs, while the CoT model is trained on `(Q + teacher CoT → answer)` pair.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This section implements **token-level emphasis** that applies higher attention weights to critical parts of responses during training, specifically targeting key facts and final answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎚️ **Emphasis Patterns**\n",
    "- **Final Answers**: `**Yes**`, `**No**`, `The answer is **X**`\n",
    "- **Reasoning Markers**: `Question 1:`, `Answer 1:`, `Therefore,`\n",
    "- **Evidence Indicators**: `Based on`, `key facts`, `need to consider`\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **Technical Implementation**\n",
    "- **TokenEmphasisDataCollator**: Custom data collator with pattern-based emphasis\n",
    "- **EmphasisSFTTrainer**: Enhanced SFT trainer with weighted loss computation\n",
    "- **Adaptive Tracking**: Monitors emphasis effectiveness during training\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📈 **Emphasis Multipliers**\n",
    "- **Stage 1**: 2.0x weight on key tokens (light emphasis)\n",
    "- **Stage 2**: 2.5x weight on key tokens (full emphasis)\n",
    "- **Configurable**: Adjustable emphasis strength per training stage\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Run These Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ **EXECUTION ORDER**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run these cells AFTER:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Enhanced Q&A-CoT training data generation\n",
    "2. ✅ Progressive curriculum dataset preparation\n",

    "## Expected Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focused Learning**: Higher attention on critical reasoning steps\n",
    "- **Better Answer Generation**: Enhanced focus on final **Yes**/**No** decisions  \n",
    "- **Improved Pattern Recognition**: Stronger learning of Q&A-CoT format\n",
    "- **Adaptive Effectiveness**: Real-time monitoring of emphasis impact\n",

    "# 🎓 PROGRESSIVE CURRICULUM TRAINING FOR Q&A-COT SELF-QUESTIONING\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This section implements a **two-stage progressive curriculum** for training the model to use Q&A Chain-of-Thought (CoT) self-questioning, as outlined in the StrategyQA Self-Improving LLM implementation plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1: Final Reasoning Training\n",
    "- **Goal**: Teach direct answer generation with basic reasoning\n",
    "- **Duration**: 1 epoch with higher learning rate (2e-5)\n",
    "- **Focus**: Learn to conclude with **Yes**/**No** answers\n",
    "- **Emphasis**: Light token emphasis (2.0x) on key facts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: Full Q&A-CoT Training  \n",
    "- **Goal**: Learn complete self-questioning format\n",
    "- **Duration**: 2 epochs with lower learning rate (1e-5)\n",
    "- **Focus**: Master \"Question 1: ... Answer 1: ... Therefore...\" format\n",
    "- **Emphasis**: Full token emphasis (2.5x) on reasoning steps and final answers\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Run These Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ **IMPORTANT EXECUTION ORDER**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run these cells AFTER:**\n",
    "1. ✅ Basic model loading and LoRA setup\n",
    "2. ✅ Student draft generation  \n",
    "3. ✅ Teacher response generation (Q&A-CoT format)\n",
    "4. ✅ Professional validation pipeline\n",
    "5. ✅ Enhanced Q&A-CoT training data generation (cell `dec8f3eb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run these cells BEFORE:**\n",
    "- Final model evaluation\n",
    "- Performance comparison with baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Typical Training Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Phase A Baseline → Student Drafts → Teacher Q&A-CoT → Validation → \n",
    "PROGRESSIVE CURRICULUM TRAINING → Enhanced Evaluation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Progressive Learning**: Easier to harder reasoning patterns\n",
    "- **Token Emphasis**: Higher attention on critical facts and answers  \n",
    "- **Format Mastery**: Reliable Q&A-CoT self-questioning behavior\n",
    "- **Improved Performance**: Better than single-stage training approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Generated\n",
    "- `models/progressive_curriculum/stage_1/` - Stage 1 model checkpoint\n",
    "- `models/enhanced_progressive_curriculum/stage_2_emphasis/` - Final enhanced model\n",
    "- `curriculum_training_results.json` - Training metrics and statistics\n",
    "- `enhanced_curriculum_training_results.json` - Enhanced training results with token emphasis\n",
